	 * - should declare a [response][AnyEndpoint.Builder.response] body
	 * - should be [safe](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Safe/HTTP)
	 * - should be [idempotent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Idempotent)
	 * - should be [cacheable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cacheable)
	 *
	 * ### Example
	 *
	 * ```kotlin

	 *     val get by get()

	 * - are not [cacheable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cacheable), as a new entity must be created each time

	 * ### Example
